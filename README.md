## Techniques
* Implemented MVC design pattern as App’s architecture to make responsibility of each component more clear. Furthermore, making the entire project more maintainable, reusable, and testable.

* Implemented class inheritance, method overloading and overriding, access control, and polymorphism throughout the App to put OOP concept into practice.

* Stored, managed, and synchronized data with Firebase. For anonymous users, stored favorite pets' data in local storage via Core Data.

* Used Map Kit to locate users and calculate the navigation routes to the location of equipment.

* Used WebRTC to practice VoIP phone call. Let lender and borrower can contact each others.
